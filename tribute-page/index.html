        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer. She is regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer.</p>
  
        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>At age 12 Ada decided she wanted to fly. She went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with imagination and passion. Her first step was to construct wings. She investigated different material and sizes. She considered various materials for the wings: paper, oilsilk, wires, and feathers. She examined the anatomy of birds to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body. She decided to write a book, Flyology, illustrating, with plates, some of her findings.</p> 
        
        <h2>Adult years</h2>
        <p>She married William, 8th Baron King, becoming Lady King. They had three homes: Ockham Park, Surrey; a Scottish estate on Loch Torridon in Ross-shire; and a house in London. They had three children: Byron, Anne Isabella and Ralph Gordon.</p>
        
        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>Lovelace died at the age of 36 – the same age that her father had died – on 27 November 1852, from uterine cancer probably exacerbated by bloodletting by her physicians.</p>
